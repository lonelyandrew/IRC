information retrieval (ir)
has changed considerably in the last years with the
expansion of the web (world wide web) and the advent of modern and
inexpensive graphical user interfaces and mass storage devices.
as a result, traditional ir textbooks have become quite out-of-date
which has led to the introduction of new ir books recently.
nevertheless, we believe that there is still great need of a book that
approaches the field in a
rigorous and complete way from a computer-science perspective (in opposition
to a user-centered perspective).
this book is an effort to partially fulfill this gap and
should be
useful for a first course
on information retrieval as well as for a graduate course on the topic.
these www pages are not a digital version of the book, nor the complete
contents of it. here you will find the preface, table of contents, glossary
and two chapters available for reading on-line. the printed
version can be ordered
directly from addison-wesley-longman.

information retrieval.
overview
the book is composed of two portions which complement and balance each
other. the core portion includes 9 chapters authored or coauthored by the
designers of the book. the second portion, which is fully integrated
with the first, is formed by 6 state-of-the-art
chapters written by
leading researchers in their fields.
a same notation and glossary
are employed in all the chapters.
thus, despite the fact that
several people contributed to the text,
this book is really much more a textbook than an edited
collection of chapters written by
separate authors. further, contrary to a collection of chapters, the
contents  and organization of this book have been carefully
designed by the main authors
to present a cohesive view of all the
important aspects of modern information
retrieval.
contents

(introduction) and 10
